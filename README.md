# Open data Notebooks

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks for making sense of various Open data sources. Work-in-progress scripts and data sources.

**Note:** Some of the notebooks are hosted in this repository. For practical reasons, some are archived in other repos. Just follow the links.**Note:** Some of the notebooks are hosted in this repository. For practical reasons, some are archived in other repos. Just follow the links.  


**Requirements:**

All notebooks use the Jupyter Notebook and Python 3. In most cases the Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Basemap are used. I recommed the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution for installing these packages with ease.
